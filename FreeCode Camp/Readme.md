Welcome to my **freeCodeCamp** project collection! 🎓  
This repository contains standalone projects I've built using **HTML** and **CSS** as part of my learning journey on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). 🛠️

## 📁 What's Inside?

Each folder in this repo is a self-contained project built with:
- 🧱 **HTML** — for structure  
- 🎨 **CSS** — for styling

These projects include:
- 🏛️ Tribute pages  
- 📄 Technical documentation  
- 📱 Responsive layouts  
- 🐱 Fun and creative designs  
...and more coming soon!

## ✨ Purpose

I'm using this space to:
- Practice and improve my web development skills 🧠  
- Track my progress through the freeCodeCamp curriculum 📈  
- Build a foundation for more interactive projects in the future 🌍

## 🚀 What's Next?

- Add more projects as I complete new challenges
