🌐 freeCodeCamp HTML & CSS Projects
Welcome to my freeCodeCamp project collection! 🎓
This repository contains standalone projects I've built using HTML and CSS as part of my learning journey on freeCodeCamp. 🛠️

📁 What's Inside?
Each folder in this repo is a self-contained project built with:

🧱 HTML — for structure

🎨 CSS — for styling

These projects include:

🏛️ Tribute pages

📄 Technical documentation

📱 Responsive layouts

🐱 Fun and creative designs
...and more coming soon!

🗂️ Folder Naming Convention
To help you understand the type of content in each folder:

🔧 Practice — These folders contain the code I wrote while actively following freeCodeCamp’s instructions step-by-step. They reflect my hands-on learning and practice through guided tutorials.

🧪 Project — These folders contain original code that I wrote myself, based on freeCodeCamp’s project requirements. I used my own design and structure choices to complete the goals.

This way, you can see both how I learned and how I applied what I learned. 😊

✨ Purpose
I'm using this space to:

Practice and improve my web development skills 🧠

Track my progress through the freeCodeCamp curriculum 📈

Build a foundation for more interactive projects in the future 🌍

🚀 What's Next?
Add more projects as I complete new challenges

Enhance existing work with animations or JavaScript

Refactor code for better accessibility and responsiveness 🎯
