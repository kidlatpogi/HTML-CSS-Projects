# 🌐 freeCodeCamp HTML & CSS Projects

Welcome to my **freeCodeCamp** project collection! 🎓  
This repository contains standalone projects I've built using **HTML** and **CSS** as part of my learning journey on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). 🛠️

## 📁 What's Inside?

Each folder in this repo is a self-contained project built with:

- 🧱 **HTML** — for structure  
- 🎨 **CSS** — for styling

These projects include:

- 🏛️ Tribute pages  
- 📄 Technical documentation  
- 📱 Responsive layouts  
- 🐱 Fun and creative designs  
- ...and more coming soon!

## 🗂️ Folder Naming Convention

To help you understand the content inside:

### 🔧 `Practice` Folders  
These contain code written while *following freeCodeCamp's step-by-step lessons*. They show hands-on practice through guided challenges.

### 🧪 `Project` Folders  
These are original solutions I wrote *based on the project requirements only*. I applied what I learned to build creative and complete projects from scratch.

This format lets you see both my **learning process** and **applied knowledge**.
